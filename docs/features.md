# Features
Blade comes packed with all kinds of features providing you with the best developer experience without having to sacrifice any power.

## Lightweight
Blade is minimal by design and is built using the functional PHP design pattern, meaning no `use` clauses or scoping shenanigans.
Blade doesn't have a single dependency making it blazing fast and easy to use.

Heck! The whole project is only a few kilobytes in size!

## Extensible
Blade heavily relies on its extensibility to offer such a high degree of flexibility. The ecosystem is centered  around [[modules]] meaning you only need to install small bits and pieces to make your application stand out.

## Easy to use
We are laser focused on minimalism and ease of use, a ton of thinking has gone into making the development process as simple as can be.

You can set up your application in only **5 lines** of code!
